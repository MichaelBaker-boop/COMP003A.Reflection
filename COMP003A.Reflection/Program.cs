            Console.WriteLine("What worked well for you over the last 8 weeks? \n Working from home worked well-ish for me, although being able to attend more lectures definitely would have helped deepen my understanding.");
            Console.WriteLine("What external resources did you use to aid your learning? \n I used mostly stack overflow. Bing AI did help out but only as far as helping when it came to finding a pathway towards a solution. Stack Overflow was the main portion of where I got my deeper learning done.");
            Console.WriteLine("What would you change about the course? \n There's not much I would change about the course, it would be nice for a full semester class like this just to have a little more time when it came to assignments. Some of the module assignments that opened Wednesday at 12:00am and due same day by 11:59pm seemed impossible for people who had other classes and other responsibilities.");
            Console.WriteLine("Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course? \n I learned a lot more than I expected in this course.");
            Console.WriteLine("What concepts were new to you? \n Most of everything past module 3 was new to me. Lists and arrays were new and interesting, learning about OOP was challenging and interesting, learning how methods worked in a program proved a nice challenge as well.");
            Console.WriteLine("What concepts have you encountered already in the past? \n A lot of the beginning concepts that were covered are things that I learned either on my own or in previous coding classes. How to make a comment, boolean expressions, logic gates, how to output a line of code to a screen.");
            Console.WriteLine("Do you have any tips/comments for the instructor? \n Just 1 tip and 1 comment: Tip: please give more time for the bigger assignments towards the end of the 8 weeks. Modules 5 and 6 were brutal to get through even with multiple days to get them done. \n Comment: You were an excellent instructor who was more than willing to help me succeed in any way you could and I'm glad we were able to communicate effectively.");
